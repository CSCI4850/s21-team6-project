# Motivation
The ultimate goal of this project was the design, construct and train a neural network to play the ancient chinese strategy board game Go on a 9x9 board featuring traditional rules. The net should play at a proficiency level that encourages the human player to employ strategic counters of their own in pursuit of forcing the net to pass or otherwise passing themselves should they find they are unable. To this end, we have accomplished our goal in creating a convolutional neural network and it can be played against as demonstrated by this demo and by you. 

# Preliminary Steps:

It is necessary to install JupyterLab. Instructions and documentation are available here: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

#Necessary Downloads

The git page contains four necessary files that must be downloaded for the network to function (the driver, network, datasets, and pretrained weights, respectively):
  1. exp_drivers.ipynb
  2. exp_GOnet.ipynb
  3. go9.zip
  4. mini_weights.h5
